## Getting Started

To get a development environment running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository in a directory of your choice.

2. Create a `.env` file (from `.env.example`) and add all the credentials
   necessary to run the app. To get those, please send James (jamesqquick) a
   message on Discord!

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
